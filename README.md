# mini_project_1


This project is a Data-Driven Web Application built using the Python ecosystem. It serves as a bridge between raw data analysis and web presentation, demonstrating how to handle datasets and serve them through a modern web framework.

Project Core Components
The Dataset (data.csv):
The heart of the project is a real estate dataset containing 4,600 rows of house sales. It includes critical variables like price, bedroom count, square footage, and geographic location (city/statezip).

The Backend (Python & Flask):

Pandas: Used for the "heavy lifting" of data manipulation. It reads the CSV and extracts the "Frontend" (first 5 rows) and "Backend" (last 5 rows).

Flask: Acts as the web server. It handles the logic of taking that data and injecting it into a format the browser can understand.

The Frontend (HTML & Bootstrap):

The project uses Jinja2 (Flask's templating engine) to pass data from Python to HTML.

Bootstrap 5 is integrated to ensure the data tables are responsive, clean, and professional-looking on both desktop and mobile devices.

Professional Workflow Implementation
Beyond just code, this project demonstrates a professional development lifecycle:

Version Control: Managed via Git, tracking every change and providing a history of the project's evolution.

Documentation: Includes a comprehensive README.md to guide other developers on how to install and run the app.

Environment Management: Utilizes a .gitignore file to ensure that only the source code is shared, keeping the repository clean of temporary files and heavy virtual environments.

What This Project Demonstrates
Full-Stack Basics: You are managing data (Database/CSV), logic (Python/Flask), and presentation (HTML/CSS).

Data Transparency: By showing both the "Head" and "Tail" of the data, the app gives an immediate overview of the dataset's range and integrity.

Deployment Readiness: Because the project is hosted on GitHub with a clean structure, it is ready to be deployed to cloud platforms like Heroku, Render, or AWS.
